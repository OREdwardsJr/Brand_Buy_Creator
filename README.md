Grab pieces from excel sheets and combine them into a central database

This program grabs a collection of excel worksheets called, "Spec Sheets", from a directory. The program converts the specified database into a list of lists, which are then inserted into a singular Excel worksheet called a "Brand Buy."

While this program displays concepts and methods for grabbing and reorganizing content within Excel, it is coded to be used for a niche process. Outside of learning, this program would need to be tweaked in order to provide value outside of its use case.

This is also one of the first programs that I wrote so it may be a little rough :)
